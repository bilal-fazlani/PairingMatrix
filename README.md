# Pairing Matrix

Pairing Matrix is a project to help developers(or others) plan their pairing in a team. It tracks when you paired with whom and provides insights of statical data. Such as of you are excessively pairing with someone or if you haven't paired with someone at all.

The Idea is pretty single. I have seem many teams using a physical board and markers for it. This is just an attempt to digitalize the procedure.

I got the inspiration from here: https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/pair-programming-matrix
