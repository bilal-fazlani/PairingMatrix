Pairing Matrix is a project to help developers(or others) plan their pairing in a team. It tracks who paired with whom and provides insights of statistical data. Such as if you are excessively pairing with someone or if you haven't paired with someone at all.

The Idea is pretty single. I have seen many teams using a physical board and markers for it. This is just an attempt to digitalize the procedure.

I got the inspiration from here: https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/pair-programming-matrix
